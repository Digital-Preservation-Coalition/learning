# Digital Preservation Learning Resources

This is a prototype site to edit and make available information and links to learning resources for digital preservation. The structure is based on the DPC Competency Framework.

## Main Website

The main, public facing site is currently at: <https://digital-preservation-coalition.github.io/learning/>

This is [generated on GitHub](https://github.com/Digital-Preservation-Coalition/learning/actions) from the source files held in this repository.  Currently, all changes are published to the main website as soon as they are made to this `main` branch. Later, we may switch to doing versioned releases.

## Editor Website

There is an editor/preview version of the site at: <https://digipres-learning-resources.netlify.app/>

This is [hosted and generated by Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/sites/digipres-learning-resources/deploys), as this makes it possible to use a [simple content management system](https://decapcms.org/) to manage the content held in this GitHub repository. This relies on GitHub for authentication, so contributors need to have permission to write to this repository in order to add or edit pages on this site.

There is a [dedicated GitHub Team](https://github.com/orgs/Digital-Preservation-Coalition/teams/dplr-team) that can be used to manage editorial membership of this service.

Note that as this CMS uses Git to store the content, there is a small delay while the sites are updated after new updates are added.
