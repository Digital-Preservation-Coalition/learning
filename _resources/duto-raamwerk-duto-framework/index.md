Translated from the website of the Dutch Nationaal Archief:

"When you apply the framework consistently, government information is findable, available, readable, interpretable, reliable and future-proof. Sustainable accessible government information â€“ *DUTO* for short. For everyone who is entitled to it and for as long as necessary. The DUTO framework is a practical tool to determine the appropriate measures with which you can make government information sustainably accessible. And thus put archiving by design into practice."
