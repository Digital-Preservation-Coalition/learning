A Guide to Distributed Digital Preservation is intentionally structured such that every chapter can stand on its own or be paired with other segments of the book at will, allowing readers to pick their own pathway through the guide as best suits their needs. This approach has necessitated that the authors and editors include some level of repetition of basic principles across chapters, and has also made the Glossary (included at the back of this guide) an essential reference resource for all readers.

This guide is written with a broad audience in mind that includes librarians, curators, archivists, scholars, technologists, lawyers, and administrators. Any resourceful reader should be able to use this guide to gain both a philosophical and practical understanding of the emerging field of distributed digital preservation (DDP), including how to establish or join a Private LOCKSS Network (PLN).
