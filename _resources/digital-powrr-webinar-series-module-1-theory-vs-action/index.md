From the webinar introduction: "In this module we're going to be talking about ways to understand what digital preservation actually looks like in practice as opposed to all of the theory that you get when you google the phrase 'Digital Preservation'. We also want to make sure in this module that you'll come out with an understanding that digital preservation is an incremental process. It's not one and done. We'll also do our best to make sure that you are able by the end of this module to make informed decisions about digital preservation tools and services based upon your organizations resources."
