The Novice to Know-How learning pathway aims to provide beginners with the skills required to develop and implement simple digital preservation workflows within their organization. It starts with a broad introduction to digital preservation issues and describes the steps we can take to address these. It then delves into potential workflows in more detail, examining the issues to consider, steps to take, and technological solutions that can be deployed. An emphasis is placed on free, easy-to-use solutions, and includes detailed demos of how to use the key tools.
