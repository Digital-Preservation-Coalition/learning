From the webinar introduction: "In this module, we're going to be going over some more information about individual tools and my goals today are to make sure that you understand that different tools and services perform different functions within that digital curation lifecycle that we talked about in Module 1 and that these tools and services can be used within your institutions workflow and it's up to you to help figure out how those tools and services can be incorporated in a way that makes sense for your organization. So today is all about investigating tools and services."
