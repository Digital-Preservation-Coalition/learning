The **Digital Research Competencies (DIRECT) Framework** is a competencies framework for Digital Research Technical Professionals. It is a community resource to support dRTPs (Digital Research Technical Professionals) in tracking and managing their professional development.


From the website:

"The DIRECT Framework helps classify and describe the wide range of technical and non-technical skills used across digital research roles. These include researchers, research software engineers (RSEs), data specialists, group leads, principal investigators (PIs), archivists, bioinformaticians, and many more. It brings together examples of tools, methods, and behaviours that demonstrate skills, alongside training resources to support skill development. The framework provides a shared language for recognising expertise, planning training, and mapping career pathways.

By combining community input with best practices from across sectors, DIRECT supports individuals in charting their professional growth while helping organisations to build stronger, more inclusive teams.

Our vision is a research ecosystem where digital skills are visible, valued, and celebrated, empowering people to shape the future of research and innovation."
