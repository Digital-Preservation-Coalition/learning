This is an experimental setup. The [search page](./search/) searchers everything as text, whereas the [Resources page](./resources/) uses a table-based search. We probably don't want both? See also <a href="{{ '/competencies/framework/' | relative_url }}">this web version of the Competencies Framework</a>, which probably doesn't belong here, but might have some useful text to re-use.
